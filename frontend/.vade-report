# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the Rosterra React application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package via npm
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` to reflect the new package installation

### 2. Fixed Incorrect Integration in main.jsx
- Removed incorrect import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next"`
- This was using the Next.js-specific package, which is not appropriate for a React/Vite application

### 3. Added SpeedInsights Component to App.jsx
- Added proper import: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react'`
- Placed the `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the Router component, after all Routes
- This ensures Speed Insights tracks all route navigations and performance metrics across the entire application

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows Vercel's official documentation for React applications:
- Used `@vercel/speed-insights/react` package (appropriate for React/Vite apps)
- Placed the component at the app root level to track all pages
- Component is wrapped inside the Router to properly track route changes

## Files Modified

- `frontend/package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `frontend/package-lock.json` - Updated with new package installation
- `frontend/src/main.jsx` - Removed incorrect Speed Insights import
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added proper Speed Insights component import and usage

## Verification

- Build completed successfully without errors
- All existing functionality preserved
- Speed Insights component properly integrated into the React component tree
